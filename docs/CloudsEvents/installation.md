# Installation

This section will guide you through all the necessary infos and the first <i>(and most basic)</i> setup for the plugin to work.

## Requirements
### Minimum
- Minecraft 1.8 or above.
- Java 11 or above.
### Recommended

## First setup
1.  After the purchase, download <b>CloudsEvents</b> from the <a href="https://discord.clouds-studios.com">Discord Server</a> through the `/download` command. Move it to your server.
2.  When you first start the plugin up it will generate the `config.yml` and shut down.
3.  To use the plugin you'll need a license key. Use the `/mylicenses` command to copy yours and paste it in the `license` field in your `config.yml`.
4.  Set a server name in the `server-name` field in your `config.yml`. <i>(Examples: "KitPvP", "BedWarsLobby", "Hub1", "MyServer")</i>
5.  Restart the server. You can now enjoy <b>CloudsEvents</b>!
